- dependability
- security
- efficiency
- acceptability
- run effectively and efficiently, easy to be extended, easy to be understood



What are the two fundamental types of software product?

- customized product which is designed to meet the needs of a single customer.



What is software engineering?

- It is a engineering discipline which concerned with all aspects of software product from specification to system maintenance.



What are the four fundamental activities in software processes?

- specification
- development
- validation
- evolution



What is the distinction between computer science and software engineering?

- CS: fundamental theories and methods of computers and software systems.
- ==SE: practice of software production==



What are the ==3 general issues== that affect many different types of software?

- heterogeneity: software has to execute in different types of systems
- business and social change: which derives different requirements for software change.
- security and trust: strong enough to against external and internal threats , only that can we trust the systems.



List 5 different types of software application?

- stand-alone
- system of system
- modeling and simulation
- embedded control
- batch processing
- entertainment
- interactive transaction-based



What ==software engineering fundamental== apply to all types of software  systems?

- System should be developed using a managed and understood development process
- Dependability and performance are key system characteristics
- Understanding and managing the software specification and requirements are important
- Effective use should be made of available resources.



What are ==three key characteristics== of the engineering of web-based software engineering?

- software reuse is the principal approach for constructing
- requirements can not be specified in advance
- user interfaces are constrained by the capability of the web browsers.

 

What is a software engineering code of ethics?

- a set of principals, standards of expected behaviors for profession software engineers.



###### Chapter 2 Software processes

What are the fundamental activities that are common to all software processes?

- specification
- design and implementation
- validation 
- evolution



List the 3 generic process models that are used in software engineering?

- waterfall
- incremental development
- reuse-oriented software engineering



Why are iterations usually limited when the waterfall model is used?

- documents-oriented
- documents are produced at the end of each phase
- cost high and lots of rework



What are the ==three benefits== of incremental development compared to the waterfall model?

- deliver and deployment
- feedback
- reduce cost when requirements changed by customers



What are the ==development stages== in reuse-based development?

- component analysis
- requirement modification
- system design with reuse
- development and integration



What are the ==principal requirements== engineering activities?

- feasibility study
- requirements elicitation and analysis
- requirements specification
- requirements validation



Why is it increasingly irrelevant to distinguish between software development and evolution?

- not completely new right now
- iteratively process is more realistic last in its lifetime of the software



What are the advantage of using ==incremental development== and delivery?

- early delivery of critical functionality
- early increments serve as prototypes to explore requirements
- lower risk of overall project failure
- more extensive testing of critical customer functionality



What are the ==4 sectors== in each loop in Boehm's spiral model?

- object setting
- risk assessment and reduction
- development and validation
- planning



What are the ==six fundamental== best practices in the RUP?

- develop software iteratively
- manage requirements
- use component-based architecture
- visually model software
- verify software quality
- control changes to software



###### Chapter 3 Agile Software Development

What are the ==shared characteristics== of different  approaches to rapid software development?

- the process of specification, design and implementation are inter-leaved
- the system is developed and delivered in a serious of versions
- user interface are often developed using an iterative development system that supports rapid ui development



For what types of system are agile approached to development particularly likely to be successful?

- small or medium-sized software development
- ensure that the customer has give us a clear commitment that he will be involved into the whole development process



List the ==5 principles== of agile methods?

- customer involved
- incremental delivery
- people not process
- embrace change
- maintain simplicity



List ==4 questions== that should be asked when deciding whether or not to adopt an agile method of software development?

- size?
- customer involved?
- incremental?
- iterativeï¼Ÿ
- type of system?
- team organize?
- subject to external regulation?



What are ==three important characteristics== of extreme programming?

- requirements expressed as scenarios
- pair-programming
- test-first development



What is test-first development?

- test code has to be written before the code that realize the function, and when new function is added, test code can be automated run.



What are the ==possible problems== of test-first development?

- short-cut,  not complete
- hard to make sure that the completeness
- some tests are difficult to write incrementally



Briefly describe the ==advantages== of pair programming?

- common ownership and responsibility
- code review process
- support refactoring



What is a ==Scrum sprint==?

- a short planning(3-4 weeks) unit in which work to be done is assessed, features are selected to be developed, the software is implemented and delivered to system stakeholders



What are the ==barriers== to introducing agile methods into large companies?

- may not wanna accept the risk of a new approach
- incompatible
- make good use of
- cultural resistance of plan-driven



###### Chapter 4 Requirements Engineering

What are user requirements and system requirements?

- user requirements: statement in a language that is understandable to users of what service the system should provide and the constraints under which it operates.
- system requirements: more detailed descriptions of the system services and constraints, written for developers of the system.



What is the distinction between ==functional and non-functional==requirements?

- functional: define what should the system do
- non-functional: not directly concerned with the functions but specify required system properties or constraints on the system or its development process



List 3 types of ==non-functional== requirement?

- product
- organisational
- external



What is the software requirements document?

- official document that defines the requirements that should be implemented by the developers



What is the distinction between the terms 'shall' and 'should' in a user requirements document, which is written in natural language?

- shall: must be done
- should: desirable but not a must



What are the main advantages of using a standard format to specify  requirements?

- easy to be read
- hard to lose some information
- automated process is possible



What are the ==principal stages== of the requirements engineering process?

- requirements elicitation and analysis
- ~ specification
- ~ validation



Give ==5 reasons== why eliciting requirements is difficult?

- do not know what they want
- language
- conflict
- political factor
- business environment change



What should be included in a ==scenario==?

- what is expected when scenario starts
- normal flow of events
- what can go wrong and how to handle it
- concurrent activities
- finish state



What is a ==use-case==?

- a use-case identifies a typical interaction with a system and the actors involved in that interaction



What is ethnography and how is it used in requirements elicitation?

- cooperation in work process





What checks should be applied during requirements validation?

- validity
- consistency
- completeness
- realism
- verifiability of the requirements



List 3 requirements validation techniques?

- requirement review
- prototyping
- test-case generation



What is requirements management?

- manage changes to requirements during specification and after the system has gone into use



What are the stages in the requirements change management process?

- problem analysis and change specification
- change analysis and costing
- change implementation
